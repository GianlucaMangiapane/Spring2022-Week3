# MUSA 650: Machine Learning in Remote Sensing

## Week3: Machine Learning, applications - Classification, Dimensionality Reduction, Feature Extraction

We will work on multiple examples and play with the data to run a complete classification example using a toy dataset. We will discuss important concepts in ML: What do we mean by "dimensionality" of a dataset. Why and how we reduce dimensionality?
